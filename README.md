# Evaluating-Factors-Influencing-Commute-Speeds-to-UBC
Given that a significant number of students commute to the University of British Columbia (UBC)
campus by either car or bus, this experiment aims to analyze the factors influencing commute speeds (in
km/h). The primary objective is to identify and evaluate key variables that may impact the average speed
of students' commutes, providing insights into potential patterns or factors affecting their travel. Data
collection is restricted to these days, as all participants commute on these days, ensuring consistency and
completeness in the dataset.
